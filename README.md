Goals:
- Post from extension to groupme
- Get notifications (basically copied from https://github.com/dmihal/GroupMe-Notifier)

To install extension:
- https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/groupme/fgaabpokhkojfifehchgohccioikblll

Troubleshooting:
- If you see a problem make an issue
- If you feel like trying to develop it more you can pull this and load the "extension" directory unpacked, make a PR and I'll merge and repack it.
- Thanks!

Updating:
- ./bin/bump-version
- https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard
- upload ./groupme.zip
