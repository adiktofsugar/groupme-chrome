Goals:
- Post from extension to groupme
- Get notifications (basically copied from https://github.com/dmihal/GroupMe-Notifier)

To install extension:
- download http://groupme-chrome.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/groupme-chrome.crx
- go to chrome://extensions/
- drag file from computer to extensions page

Troubleshooting:
- If you see a problem make an issue
- If you feel like trying to develop it more you can pull this and load the "extension" directory unpacked, make a PR and I'll merge and repack it.
- Thanks!
